# MasterMech
A shared repository for uploading, organizing, and accessing all Master's program notes and resources. Collaborate with colleagues to build a comprehensive study hub. Everyone is welcome to contribute their materials, making it easier to stay prepared and support each other. Let’s create a central knowledge base together! 🚀

In the masters we had quite a lot of oral exams where we haven't taken notes. Maybe you can make notes and upload the questions you remember
