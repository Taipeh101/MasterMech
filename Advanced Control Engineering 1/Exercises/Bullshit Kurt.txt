Event based camera meaning and advantage

Name three main features of a camera? How do you select a Camera?
- Area(line scale, ...) / Connector to the lense(c-mount) / Black and white or Color or Infrared

Draw a lense with beams
- Pinhole / No Iris / 4 Paramters / Formula and Calculation
- Thin lense / Iris / 5 Paramters / Formula and Calculation
- Construct the Beams 

What is the Meaning of a format (relation ship to the area)
- lense format and camera needs to suit

What is the meaning of the Iris and what Numbers can the Iris have?
Meaning of the deapth of sharpness?
Relation ship of DOS and the number of the iris?
Relation ship of DOS and the opening iris?


Raylay Resolution Meaning and Formula of the blurred diameter of the lense with respect of the number of the iris?
